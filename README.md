Ah, I see! Let's clarify this:

When you run the command:

```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
```

You're installing the **Laravel Installer** globally on your machine. This is **different** from installing Laravel into a specific project.

### Why use the Laravel Installer?
The **Laravel Installer** is a tool that lets you easily create new Laravel projects using a simple command like:

```bash
laravel new project-name
```

Instead of running `composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel` every time you want to create a new Laravel project, the **Laravel Installer** simplifies the process.

### To summarize:

- **Without the Laravel Installer**:
   You would need to run something like:
   ```bash
   composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel project-name
   ```
   to create a new Laravel project.

- **With the Laravel Installer**:
   After running `composer global require laravel/installer`, you can simply run:
   ```bash
   laravel new project-name
   ```
   to create a new Laravel project.

The installer just adds a convenience layer to make creating projects easier, but **itâ€™s optional**. If you prefer to use `composer create-project` directly, you can skip installing the Laravel Installer.

In short:
- **`composer global require laravel/installer`** is for globally installing a command-line tool that helps you quickly create new Laravel projects.
- **Artisan** (which comes with Laravel) is used for tasks within a Laravel project (e.g., migration, generating controllers, running servers).

Does that make sense?
